# Personal Portfolio Website
This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, which is live at [ctrlne.github.io.](https://ctrlne.github.io/)

## Overview
This is a static, single-page portfolio designed to showcase my skills and projects as a data scientist and developer. It was built from scratch to be clean, modern, and fully responsive.

## Tech Stack
The website is intentionally lightweight and built with fundamental web technologies:

- HTML5: For the structure and content.

- Tailwind CSS: For all styling and layout, enabling a rapid and modern design process.

- JavaScript: For dynamic features like the interactive particle animation and smooth scrolling.

- GitHub Pages: For hosting the static site directly from this repository.

## How to Run Locally
1. Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/ctrlne/ctrlne.github.io.git

2. Navigate into the folder:

cd ctrlne.github.io

3. Open the index.html file in your web browser.
